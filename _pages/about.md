I'm a Software Engineer and Data Scientist with a deep passion for building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. My expertise spans Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Engineering, and Distributed Systems. I specialize in designing and deploying end-to-end machine learning pipelines and AI-driven solutionsâ€”from raw data ingestion to model deployment in production environments.

Over the years, I've led and contributed to several projects involving large-scale data platforms, recommender systems, and LLM-based architectures, often combining cutting-edge open-source tools with robust engineering practices.

Beyond the technical, I enjoy mentoring, teaching, and collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI and data. I'm always looking for meaningful collaborations, challenging problems, and opportunities to turn innovative ideas into impactful solutions.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
