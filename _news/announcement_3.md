I am thrilled to announce that I will be moving to Canada in 2024 to start a PhD program at the University of Montreal. This is an incredible opportunity for me to delve deeper into my academic pursuits and contribute to the field of Automating Model Driven Design using Large Language Model (LLM) agents.

Under the esteemed supervision of Prof. Houari Sahraoui and Michalis Famelis, I will be exploring innovative approaches to integrating LLM agents into model-driven design processes. This research aims to revolutionize how we approach software design and development, making it more efficient and adaptive. Some of the key topics I will be focusing on include:

- **Automation in Software Design**: Investigating how LLM agents can automate various aspects of the software design process, reducing manual effort and increasing accuracy.
- **Model-Driven Engineering**: Exploring the principles of model-driven engineering and how they can be enhanced using advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Collaborative Design**: Studying how LLM agents can facilitate better collaboration among design teams, ensuring cohesive and consistent design practices.
- **Validation and Verification**: Developing methods for validating and verifying designs generated by LLM agents to ensure they meet specified requirements and standards.

This journey will be challenging and rewarding, and I am excited to share my progress and findings with the academic community.
