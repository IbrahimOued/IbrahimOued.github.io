**Exciting Announcement: Joining Centre MURAZ as Data Science Manager for the Afroscreen Project**

I am thrilled to announce that I will be joining the esteemed [Centre MURAZ](https://www.afroscreen.org/en/network/), a technical division of the National Institute of Public Health in Burkina Faso, as the Data Science Manager for the [Afroscreen project](https://www.afroscreen.org/en/).

This incredible opportunity allows me to contribute to a project that is at the forefront of public health innovation in Africa. The Afroscreen project is a French response initiative against COVID-19, aimed at strengthening the surveillance of virus variants across 13 African countries. By structuring an African network, Afroscreen enhances laboratory sequencing capacities, promotes data sharing, and ensures effective monitoring of virus circulation. This project is crucial for understanding the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants and optimizing public health measures targeting COVID-19.

At Centre MURAZ, I will be part of a team dedicated to preventing, diagnosing, and controlling communicable and non-communicable diseases through rigorous health research. Our work will directly impact national and regional health recommendations, contributing to the deployment of operational research projects that address critical health challenges.

I am particularly excited about the collaborative nature of the Afroscreen project, which involves various stakeholders, including the Sourou Sanou University Hospital and other public health entities in Burkina Faso. This collaboration has already led to significant achievements, such as the publication of scientific articles on the circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in the general population of Burkina Faso.

Joining this project is not just a career milestone for me; it is an opportunity to be part of real-impact solutions that improve health outcomes and save lives. I am eager to bring my expertise in data science to support the Afroscreen project's mission and contribute to the global fight against COVID-19.

Thank you to everyone who has supported me on this journey. I look forward to sharing more updates as I embark on this exciting new chapter.
