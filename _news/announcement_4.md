I am delighted to announce the completion of my master’s degree thesis at the Virtual University of Burkina Faso, specializing in Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence. This significant milestone marks the culmination of rigorous research and dedication, and I am profoundly grateful for the guidance and support I received throughout this journey.

Under the expert supervision of Dr. Rodrique Kafando and Dr. Tegadwende Bissyande, my thesis focused on applying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for legal text data retrieval and accessing them through a chatbot interface. This research aimed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of retrieving legal information, making it more accessible to users without specialized legal knowledge.

The primary objectives of my research included:

- **Development of RAG Methods**: Implementing advanced RAG techniques to improve the retrieval of relevant legal texts from extensive databases.
- **Integration with Chatbot Systems**: Designing a user-friendly chatbot interface that allows users to interactively access legal information.
- **Evaluation of System Performance**: Assessing the performance of the proposed system in terms of accuracy, response time, and user satisfaction.
- **Enhancing Accessibility**: Ensuring that the system is accessible to a wide range of users, including those without a legal background.

This research contributes to the broader field of artificial intelligence by demonstrating the potential of RAG methods in specialized domains such as legal studies. It also highlights the importance of making complex information systems more user-friendly and accessible.
