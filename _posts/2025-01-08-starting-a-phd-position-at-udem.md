## A New Chapter in Montreal

After years of dedication, learning, and exploration in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering, Iâ€™m thrilled to announce that Iâ€™ve officially started my PhD at the **UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al** ðŸŽ‰. This marks a significant milestone in my professional and personal journey â€” one Iâ€™m incredibly excited and grateful for.

What makes this moment even more special is the opportunity to work under the supervision of two brilliant minds: **Prof. Houari Sahraoui** and **Prof. Michalis Famelis**. Both are internationally respected researchers in software engineering and have been driving forces behind advancements in model-driven engineering and formal reasoning.

## Welcome to GEODES and DIRO

My research will take place within the **GEODES lab** at the **DÃ©partement dâ€™Informatique et de Recherche OpÃ©rationnelle (DIRO)**. GEODES is known for its impactful work on software modeling, system design, and program analysis. The lab provides a stimulating and collaborative environment where innovation thrives at the intersection of theory and practice.

Being part of DIRO â€” one of the most renowned computer science departments in Canada â€” is both a privilege and a responsibility I take to heart.

## My Research Focus

At the heart of my doctoral journey lies a question that keeps evolving with every major leap in AI:

> **How can we automate model-driven software design using Large Language Models (LLMs) and intelligent agents?**

This is the core of my research: **leveraging LLM-based agents to support and automate Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)** tasks. From model synthesis and transformation to design validation and documentation, I aim to explore how modern LLMs can act as collaborative design agents in the software development lifecycle.

This ambitious direction bridges AI, Software Engineering, and Human-AI collaboration â€” and I couldn't think of a better academic ecosystem to pursue it.

## First Impressions

Arriving in Montreal has been both exciting and humbling. The campus itself is beautiful â€” nestled at the foot of Mount Royal and buzzing with activity. The main building of UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al stands tall and majestic, a perfect reflection of the university's academic strength and cultural significance.

And yes, I had to take that *classic photo* by the university logo â€” a memory Iâ€™ll hold onto as the beginning of a new era.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

This is just the beginning. Over the coming months (and years), Iâ€™ll be diving deep into research, contributing to academic publications, collaborating with other labs, and sharing insights along the way.

Stay tuned for more updates â€” especially if you're curious about AI agents, software models, or just the everyday life of a PhD student in beautiful Montreal ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.
