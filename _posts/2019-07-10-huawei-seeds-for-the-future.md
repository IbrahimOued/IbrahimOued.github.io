Recently, I had the incredible opportunity to travel to China as part of a cultural and educational trip organized by Huawei. This journey was not only an exploration of Chinese culture and cuisine but also a deep dive into the world of advanced technology.

### The Journey Begins

Our adventure started at the International Airport of Ouagadougou. From there, we flew to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, then to Shanghai, and finally arrived in Beijing. The long journey was filled with anticipation and excitement for the experiences ahead.

### Cultural Immersion

Upon our arrival in Beijing, we were greeted with warm hospitality. The first few days were dedicated to exploring the city and its rich history. We visited iconic landmarks, tasted delicious local dishes, and experienced the vibrant culture that China has to offer.
We also took some courses on Chinese culture, which helped us understand the traditions and values that shape the lives of the people here.

Plus the language courses we had another opportunity to learn some basic Mandarin phrases, chinese calligraphy and even some traditional Chinese painting techniques. These experiences enriched our understanding of the culture and allowed us to connect with the local people on a deeper level.

### Exploring Beijing

We spent a week in Beijing, immersing ourselves in the rich Chinese culture. We visited historical sites, enjoyed authentic Chinese cuisine, and even learned some basic Mandarin phrases. The city's vibrant atmosphere and deep-rooted traditions left a lasting impression on all of us.



### Shenzhen and Huawei

After our cultural week in Beijing, we traveled to Shenzhen, where we visited various Huawei installations. The highlight of our trip was a bootcamp focused on cutting-edge technologies such as 5G, Big Data, AI, and IoT. We gained invaluable insights and hands-on experience in these fields.

### Returning Home

Upon our return to Ouagadougou, we were honored to meet with the Ministry of Innovation, some staff of the ministry, the CEO of Huawei Burkina, and the Ambassador of China in Burkina Faso. It was a wonderful opportunity to share our experiences and discuss potential collaborations.

This trip was an unforgettable blend of cultural immersion and technological exploration. I am grateful for the opportunity and look forward to applying what I have learned in my future endeavors.
